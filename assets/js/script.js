PsuedoCode:
create a game by clicking a start buttom
game should be timed
users should attempt to guess the correct word that is hidden on the page
- "_" should be the placeholders for all letters originally
- after typing one of the letters in the word, that letter should pop up on the screen
- game should end if the user guessing the word correctly (add +1 to their total wins)
- game should end if the timer runs out before the user guesses the word (add +1 to their total losses)
display record of wins and losses 

What to use in content: 
- timer (activity 9-10)
- keyboard event (activity 15-16)
- store the record on local (activities 21-26)
- set interval
- need a function for interval
- need function to set wins
- need function to set losses
- need function to grab wins
- need function to grab losses

- remember to use text.content
